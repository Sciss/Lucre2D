             * Now keep in mind that the Y coefficients of the polynomial form
             * of the curve are calculated from the Y coordinates which define
             * our curve.  They should theoretically define the same curve,
             * but they can be off by a couple of bits of precision after the
             * math is done and so can represent a slightly modified curve.
             * This is normally not an issue except when we have solutions near
             * the endpoints.  Since the answers we get from solving the polynomial
             * may be off by a few bits that means that they could lie just a
             * few bits of precision outside the [0,1] range.
             *
             * Another problem could be that while the parametric curve defined
             * by the Y coordinates has a local minima or maxima at or just
             * outside of the endpoints, the polynomial form might express
             * that same min/max just inside of and just shy of the Y coordinate
             * of that endpoint.  In that case, if we solve for a Y coordinate
             * at or near that endpoint, we may be solving for a Y coordinate
             * that is below that minima or above that maxima and we would find
             * no solutions at all.
             *
             * In either case, we can assume that y is so near one of the
             * endpoints that we can just collapse it onto the nearest endpoint
             * without losing more than a couple of bits of precision.
