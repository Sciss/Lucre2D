/**
  * An `Area` object stores and manipulates a
  * resolution-independent description of an enclosed area of
  * 2-dimensional space.
  * `Area` objects can be transformed and can perform
  * various Constructive Area Geometry (CAG) operations when combined
  * with other `Area` objects.
  * The CAG operations include area
  * `#`, `#`,
  * `#`, and `#`.
  * See the linked method documentation for examples of the various
  * operations.
  * <p>
  * The `Area` class implements the `Shape`
  * interface and provides full support for all of its hit-testing
  * and path iteration facilities, but an `Area` is more
  * specific than a generalized path in a number of ways:
  * <ul>
  * <li>Only closed paths and sub-paths are stored.
  * `Area` objects constructed from unclosed paths
  * are implicitly closed during construction as if those paths
  * had been filled by the `Graphics2D.fill` method.
  * <li>The interiors of the individual stored sub-paths are all
  * non-empty and non-overlapping.  Paths are decomposed during
  * construction into separate component non-overlapping parts,
  * empty pieces of the path are discarded, and then these
  * non-empty and non-overlapping properties are maintained
  * through all subsequent CAG operations.  Outlines of different
  * component sub-paths may touch each other, as long as they
  * do not cross so that their enclosed areas overlap.
  * <li>The geometry of the path describing the outline of the
  * `Area` resembles the path from which it was
  * constructed only in that it describes the same enclosed
  * 2-dimensional area, but may use entirely different types
  * and ordering of the path segments to do so.
  * </ul>
  * Interesting issues which are not always obvious when using
  * the `Area` include:
  * <ul>
  * <li>Creating an `Area` from an unclosed (open)
  * `Shape` results in a closed outline in the
  * `Area` object.
  * <li>Creating an `Area` from a `Shape`
  * which encloses no area (even when "closed") produces an
  * empty `Area`.  A common example of this issue
  * is that producing an `Area` from a line will
  * be empty since the line encloses no area.  An empty
  * `Area` will iterate no geometry in its
  * `PathIterator` objects.
  * <li>A self-intersecting `Shape` may be split into
  * two (or more) sub-paths each enclosing one of the
  * non-intersecting portions of the original path.
  * <li>An `Area` may take more path segments to
  * describe the same geometry even when the original
  * outline is simple and obvious.  The analysis that the
  * `Area` class must perform on the path may
  * not reflect the same concepts of "simple and obvious"
  * as a human being perceives.
  * </ul>
