/**
  * The `Shape` interface provides definitions for objects
  * that represent some form of geometric shape.  The `Shape`
  * is described by a `PathIterator` object, which can express the
  * outline of the `Shape` as well as a rule for determining
  * how the outline divides the 2D plane into interior and exterior
  * points.  Each `Shape` object provides callbacks to get the
  * bounding box of the geometry, determine whether points or
  * rectangles lie partly or entirely within the interior
  * of the `Shape`, and retrieve a `PathIterator`
  * object that describes the trajectory path of the `Shape`
  * outline.
  * <p>
  * <a id="def_insideness"><b>Definition of insideness:</b></a>
  * A point is considered to lie inside a
  * `Shape` if and only if:
  * <ul>
  * <li> it lies completely
  * inside the `Shape` boundary <i>or</i>
  * <li>
  * it lies exactly on the `Shape` boundary <i>and</i> the
  * space immediately adjacent to the
  * point in the increasing `X` direction is
  * entirely inside the boundary <i>or</i>
  * <li>
  * it lies exactly on a horizontal boundary segment <b>and</b> the
  * space immediately adjacent to the point in the
  * increasing `Y` direction is inside the boundary.
  * </ul>
  * <p>The `contains` and `intersects` methods
  * consider the interior of a `Shape` to be the area it
  * encloses as if it were filled.  This means that these methods
  * consider
  * unclosed shapes to be implicitly closed for the purpose of
  * determining if a shape contains or intersects a rectangle or if a
